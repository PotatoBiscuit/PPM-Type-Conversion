# PPM-Type-Conversion
This conversion software only manages P6 and P3 PPM files.

Conversions go as follows:

1. P3 to P3

2. P6 to P3

3. P3 to P6

4. P6 to P6

To use this program, type this into your terminal (after running the makefile):

ppmrw (3/6)(Convert to P3 or P6) input.ppm output.ppm

Notes:

-This software does not support comments. It will usually produce an error message. However, apart from comments, it is quite robust. Good luck breaking it!
